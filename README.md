    About Me
A game board (10x10) made up of custom user controls:
    A button that sits on top of a panel
    The panel will display the number of mines in the adjacent cells (or if it has a mine, the       mine itself)
    The button disappears when clicked.
A Status Strip on the bottom of the form that displays a timer which shows how long (in seconds) the user has been playing a particular round.
    The time starts on the first button press!
